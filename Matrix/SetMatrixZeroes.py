#  -> I used the first row and first column as markers to track which rows and columns should be set to zero, while separately storing whether the first row or first column originally contained a zero to avoid losing information.

#  -> Time Complexity : O(m * n) - The matrix is traversed a constant number of times (marking, zeroing rows, zeroing columns), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

#  -> Space Complexity : O(1) - The solution modifies the matrix in place and uses only a few extra variables, achieving constant auxiliary space without any additional data structures.👇
